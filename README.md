## Target

Target hardware for prototyping is the Raspberry Pi 2. It's ARMv7 with Neon, but building without Neon support should do for now. Target OS is the latest Raspbian which is based on Debian 8.0 Jessie.


## Toolchain

Rust 1.8+ is required. We're building with rust nightly (1.8.0 as of 2016-02-15, with ```rustc -V``` reporting: *rustc 1.8.0-nightly (fae516277 2016-02-13)*)

## Docker image

Instead of compiling or installing a cross compiling toolchain yourself, you can simply use this docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/fabricedesre/rustpi2/

Once you have pulled the image, follow these steps to compile any Rust program:
* Enter the program's directory: `cd $program_directory`
* Run the image: ``docker run -v `pwd`:/home/rustpi2/source -v $HOME/.cargo:/home/rustpi2/.cargo fabricedesre/rustpi2 cargopi build [options]``

The `cargopi` command is equivalent to `cargo --target=armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`.

## Cross Compilation Toolchain

If you prefer to cross-compile on your dev system, this is the way to go. There is an extensive write-up of the process at https://github.com/japaric/rust-cross. There's also an experimental, pre-compiled toolchain at 
https://people.mozilla.org/~fdesre/rust-rpi2.tar.gz which Fabrice built on Ubuntu 15.10. It is linked against a specific version of libstdc++.so.6 (GLIBCXX_3.4.21), so it may or may not work on other distributions. Ubuntu 15.04 is reportedly no good.

 * Download and and unpack toolchain linked above in $toolchain
 * Add $toolchain/x-tools/bin and $toolchain/bin to your PATH
 * Add $toolchain/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

To build a rust file:

``` bash
$ rustc --target=armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf -C linker=armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf-g++ hello.rs
```

## Building and running locally on Linux

This should work straight-forward. Install a rust nightly via multirust, clone the repo, and then cargo run.


## Building and running locally on OS X

``` bash
$ brew install openssl
$ brew install multirust
$ multirust update
$ multirust default nightly
```

This is required to build the openssl crate using homebrew's openssl:

``` bash
$ export DEP_OPENSSL_INCLUDE=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include/
$ export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2f/include/
```

This then builds and runs the project locally:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox
$ cd foxbox
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```


## Building on Raspbian

Rustc doesn't build natively on the Raspberry Pi, yet, because the rust team is not offering ARM binaries for staging at this point. However, there are working ARMv7 binary builds at https://github.com/warricksothr/RustBuild . Grab and install a nightly build of rust, rustlib, and cargo from there. After that, clone and cargo run the Foxbox repo.
