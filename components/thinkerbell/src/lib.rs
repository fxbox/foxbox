#![feature(custom_derive, rustc_macro)]
//! This create defines mechanisms for executing simple scripts on the
//! server.
//!
//! By design, these scripts have limited capabilities. Each script
//! takes the form of a set of rules: "when any of the input services
//! of foo matches some condition, send some value to all of the onput
//! services of bar".
//!
//! See module `ast` for more details on the grammar of scripts.
