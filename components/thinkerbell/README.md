# ThinkerBell: A scripting engine for the world of IoT

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/fxbox/thinkerbell.svg?branch=master)](https://api.travis-ci.org/fxbox/thinkerbell)

ThinkerBell is two things:
- an engine designed to let users assemble scripts to automate their devices, without any knowledge of programming;
- an engine designed to be embedded in a scripting language, to let developers assemble more sophisticated scripts to automate devices.

The scripts offered by ThinkerBell are designed to be executed on the FoxBox (i.e. a local server). Some of the scripts need to interact with a client-side application, executed on an interactive smart device (i.e. smartphone, smarttv, tablet, computer).

ThinkerBell is written in Rust, as part of the FoxBox architecture.
